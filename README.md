# SeedFilter

A minecraft seed filter which looks for village, bastion, and nether fortress locations to find decent speedrunning seeds.

Not very good because cubiomes (the library I am using) does not support lava pools / getting the loot inside of chests, and I am not interested in implementing that myself.
